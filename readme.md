[Witrels](https://github.com/nivaca/witrels) is a Python script which compares TEI-XML diplomatic transcriptions 
created according to the [SCTA standards](http://community.scta.info/pages/lombardpress-schema-diplomatic.html).
It produces a table of frequencies (and a pie chart) of the correspondences relations which exist between 
parallel segments across all witnesses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- collatex~=2.2
- beautifulsoup4~=4.9.0
- lxml>=4.6.0
- tqdm>=4.60.0
- pandas>=1.2.0
- requests>=2.25.0
- levenshtein>=0.12.0
- plotly>=4.14.0
- kaleido>=0.2.0

[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) and [Kaleido](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido)
are optional, as they are required only to produce a pie chart 
and render it on a web browser.


## Installation
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/nivaca/witrels` 
2. `cd witrels`   
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt `

 
## How Does It Work
In the [data.lst](https://github.com/nivaca/witrels/blob/main/data.lst) file a list of URLs of TEI-XML files is included.
For instance:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scta-texts/wodehamordinatio/master/b1-d1-q13/maz_b1-d1-q13.xml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scta-texts/wodehamordinatio/master/b1-d1-q13/sorb193_b1-d1-q13.xml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scta-texts/wodehamordinatio/master/b1-d1-q13/tara_b1-d1-q13.xml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scta-texts/wodehamordinatio/master/b1-d1-q13/vatlat955_b1-d1-q13.xml
```

These files must all be valid witnesses of a same document. 
Ideally, they must have been created following the the [SCTA standards](http://community.scta.info/pages/lombardpress-schema-diplomatic.html) for diplomatic editions, 
although other TEI-p5-compliant files might be correcly processed. 
It is required, however, that all documents be structurally identical.
Such an isomorphism is ensured by using the same number of textual paragraphs (`//text//p`)
with the same `@xml:id`.
   
For instance, witness 1 (`#V`) can have:

```xml
<p xml:id="b1d3qun-cdtvet">
    <lb ed="#V" n="12"/>Circa distinctionem tertiam quaero utrum mens humana sit  imago trinitatis increatae sicut in rebus aliis factis propter hominem
    <lb ed="#V" n="13"/>est vestigium eiusdem trinitatis
</p>
```

while witness 2 (`#T`) can have:

```xml
<p xml:id="b1d3qun-cdtvet">
    <note type="marginal-note" place="margin-left">distinctio tertia</note>
    <lb ed="#T" n="42"/><hi rend="ii-3">C</hi>irca distinctionem tertiam quaero utrum mens humana sit ymago trinitatis increatae sicut
    <lb ed="#T" n="43"/>in rebus aliis factis propter hominem est vestigium eiusdem trinitatis
</p>
```

All elements are stripped off for comparison: `<note>`, `<lb/`, and so on. (See [xmlcleaners.py](https://github.com/nivaca/witrels/blob/main/xmlcleaners.py) for details.)

A [Python port](https://interedition.github.io/collatex/pythonport.html) 
of the [CollateX](https://collatex.net/) tool set is used to compare each `<p>` across all witnesses. 
Collatex breaks the text down into several segments and then produces a json output of its comparison 
(see [here](https://collatex.net/doc/#json-output) for details).
[Witrels](https://github.com/nivaca/witrels) then parses and analises this output, 
and performs very simple statistical analysis in order to reveal 
similarity relationships between the witnesses.

A typical output will be:

```
ABBB: 31.21%
ABAA: 15.41%
AACA: 13.77%
AAAD: 9.13%
ABBA: 7.17%
AACC: 6.63%
ABCC: 3.82%
ABAB: 3.13%
ABBD: 2.18%
ABCB: 2.12%
ABCA: 2.05%
AACD: 1.64%
ABAD: 0.88%
ABCD: 0.85%
```

with the corresponding pie chart being:

## Interpreting the Output
[Witrels](https://github.com/nivaca/witrels) sorts the witnesses alphabetically according to their file names.
In our example: `maz`, `sorb193`, `tara`, and `vatlat955`.

Correspondence relations are designated with `n`-letter codes 
(where `n` is the number of witnesses), for example `AAAB`. 
From left to right, each column (or position) corresponds to a witnesses (according the the sorting described above).
Sameness of letter (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, etc.) means that the witnesses have the same reading in a certain segment,
whereas difference in letter means that they have different readings.


For example, the code `AAAB` means that in a certain segment, 
the first three witnesses have exactly the same reading, 
while they all differ from the last one witness.
Of course, if all witnesses have the same reading in a segment, the corresponding code will be `AAAA`.
And if all witnesses have a different reading, the code will be `ABCD`.


[Witrels](https://github.com/nivaca/witrels) assigns a code to the correspondence relation 
of each segment in every paragraph, and then calculates the frequency in which they occur.
The output table (and corresponding pie chart) shows such frequencies (as percentages).

Accordingly, an output like `ABBB: 31.21%` means that in 31.21% of all segments, the last three witnesses 
had identical readings, while differing from the first witness;
an output like `ABAA: 15.41%` means that in 15.41% of all segments, the first, third, and fourth witnesses
had identical reading, while differing from the second one; 
and output like `AAAD: 9.13%` means that in `9.13%` of all segments, the first three witnesses coincided,
while they diverged from the last witness;
and so on.


## TODO
- Generalise for more than four witnesses.
